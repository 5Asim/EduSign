# EduSign

EduSign is a groundbreaking web extension designed to bridge the communication gap by translating text and audio into sign language using cutting-edge AI technologies. This is the first-of-its-kind software that integrates sign language recognition, video synthesis, and real-time processing to create an inclusive digital experience.

## Features
- **Sign Language Recognition**: Uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to accurately recognize sign language gestures.
- **Text Translation**: Converts written text into ASL.
- **Video Transcription**: Captures and processes video audio, generating sign language representations.
- **Video Synthesis**: Implements frame-sequencing using the Stable Diffusion API to generate smooth sign language animations.
- **Self-Created Dataset**: Trained on a custom dataset to improve accuracy and adaptability.
- **Web Scraping**: Utilizes Puppeteer to extract sign language data from Sign.mt, ensuring high-quality training data.
- **Real-Time Processing**: Built with Server-Sent Events (SSE) for seamless updates.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Powered by Vue.js for a smooth and accessible experience.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: Vue.js
- **Backend**: Python with SSE (Server-Sent Events)
- **Machine Learning**: CNN-based sign recognition  
- **Web Scraping**: Puppeteer
- **Video Synthesis**: Stable Diffusion API for frame-sequencing
- **Web Speech API**: For real-time audio transcription (Self-made)



## Usage
- Open the browser extension.
- Input text or upload a video.
- Receive real-time sign language translations.
